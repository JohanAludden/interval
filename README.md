# Interval library

# TODO
- [x] Have support for closed intervals [1-3]
- [x] Have a good string representation
- [x] Be values classes (equals & hashCode)
- [x] Know if a value is in the range
- [x] Have support for open intervals (1-3)
- [x] Support mixed intervals (open and closed)
- [] Support unbounded intervals
- [] Combine two intervals overlapping ranges, (1-4] + [2-6) => (1-6)
- [] Combine two intervals, (1-4] + [2-6) => (1-6)
- [] Know if 2 intervals overlaps
- [] Know if 2 intervals are not overlapping
- [] Know if 1 intervals is included in an other interval
- [] Make it generic intervals (is Comparable enough?)
- [] Error handling
